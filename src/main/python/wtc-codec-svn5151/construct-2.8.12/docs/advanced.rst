Integers and floats
===================

Basic computer science 101. All integers follow Int{8,16,24,32,64}{u,s}{b,l,n} and floats follow Float{32,64}{b,l} a naming pattern. Endianness can be either big-endian, little-endian or native. Integers can be signed or unsigned (non-negative only). Floats do not have a native endianness nor unsigned type.

>>> Int64sl.build(500)
b'\xf4\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
>>> Int64sl.build(-23)
b'\xe9\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff'

Few fields have aliases, Byte among integers and Single/Double among floats.

::

    Byte    <-->  Int8ub
    Short   <-->  Int16ub
    Int     <-->  Int32ub
    Long    <-->  Int64ub
    Single  <-->  Float32b
    Double  <-->  Flaot64b

Integers can also be variable-length encoded for compactness. Google invented a popular encoding:

>>> VarInt.build(1234567890)
b'\xd2\x85\xd8\xcc\x04'

Long integers (or those of particularly odd sizes) can be encoded using a fixed-sized `BytesInteger`. Here is a 128-bit integer.

>>> BytesInteger(16).build(255)
b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xff'

Numbers of processor sizes are implemented using `struct` module, others use a custom field.

>>> FormatField("<","l").build(1)
b'\x01\x00\x00\x00'



Bytes and bits
==============

"Strings" of bytes (`str` in PY2 and `bytes` in PY3) can be moved around as-is. Bits are discussed in a later chapter.

>>> Bytes(5).build(b"12345")
b'12345'
>>> Bytes(5).parse(b"12345")
b'12345'

Bytes can also be consumed until end of stream.

>>> GreedyBytes.parse(b"39217839219...")
b'39217839219...'


Strings
========

.. warning:: Strings in Construct work very much like strings in other languages. Be warned however, that Python 2 used byte strings that are now called `bytes`. Python 3 introduced unicode strings which require an encoding to be used, utf-8 being the best option. When no encoding is provided on Python 3, those constructs work on byte strings similar to Bytes and GreedyBytes fields. Encoding can be set once, globally using :func:`~construct.core.setglobalstringencoding` or provided with each field separately.

String is a fixed-length construct that pads builded string with null bytes, and strips those same null bytes when parsing. Note that some encodings do not work properly because they return null bytes within the encoded stream, utf-16 and utf-32 for example.

>>> String(10).build(b"hello")
b'hello\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'

>>> String(10, encoding="utf8").build("Афон")
b'\xd0\x90\xd1\x84\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd\x00\x00'

You can use different bytes for padding (although they will break any encoding using those within the stream). Strings can also be trimmed when building. If you supply a too long string, the construct will chop if apart instead of raising a StringError.

>>> String(10, padchar=b"XYZ", paddir="center").build(b"abc")
b'XXXabcXXXX'

>>> String(10, trimdir="right").build(b"12345678901234567890")
b'1234567890'

PascalString is a variable length string that is prefixed by a length field. This scheme was invented in Pascal language that put Byte field instead of C convention of appending \0 byte at the end. Note that the length field can be variable length itself, as shown below. VarInt should be preferred when building new protocols.s

>>> PascalString(VarInt, encoding="utf8").build("Афон")
b'\x08\xd0\x90\xd1\x84\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd'

CString is an another variable length string, that always ends with a null \0 terminating byte at the end. This scheme was invented in C language and is known in the computer science community very well. One of the authors, Kernighan or Ritchie, admitted that it was one of the most regretable design decisions in history.

>>> CString(encoding="utf8").build(b"hello")
b'hello\x00'

Last but not least, a GreedyString does the same thing that GreedyBytes does. It reads until the end of stream and decodes it using the specified encoding.

>>> GreedyString(encoding="utf8").parse(b"329817392189")
'329817392189'


Other short fields
===================

Booleans are flags:

>>> Flag.parse(b"\x01")
True

Enums translate between string names and usually integer vaues:

>>> Enum(Byte, g=8, h=11).parse(b"\x08")
'g'
>>> Enum(Byte, g=8, h=11).build(11)
b'\x0b'

>>> FlagsEnum(Byte, a=1, b=2, c=4, d=8).parse(b"\x03")
Container(c=False)(b=True)(a=True)(d=False)
